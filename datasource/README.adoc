= Download the Data Sources

For this project, the link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset[News Category Dataset] from Kaggle is used. Note that an account at Kaggle is required to be able
to download the JSON file into this directory. 

For further data processing, it is more convenient if the data is in a CSV format instead of JSON. Therefore, the following steps
will convert the JSON file into a CSV file:

.Create a new CSV file which will hold the data:
----
touch News_Category_Dataset_v3.csv
----

.Build the Docker image to be able to run the script without the need to install additional requirements:
----
docker image build -t json-to-csv:1.0.0 .
----

.Run the container:
----
docker run -v "/$(pwd)/News_Category_Dataset_v3.csv:/usr/app/src/News_Category_Dataset_v3.csv" json-to-csv:1.0.0
----
